I started out running the the HV on the bare metal of the workstation. 
My goals are as follows:
  Create a central node that I can use to manage all the hardware and software that I want to run
  Learn VM's and containers, and how they work.
  test the differences between hardware bridges and PCI passthroughs 
  Create a cluster and learn load balanceing
  Create a reliable means of backup and restoration
